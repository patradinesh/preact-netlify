Instructions:

8. Add the chopped mint and cilantro leaves on top. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes until the rice is cooked through.
9. Once the biryani is done, turn off the heat and let it rest for 5-10 minutes.
10. Serve the biryani hot, garnished with lemon wedges.
